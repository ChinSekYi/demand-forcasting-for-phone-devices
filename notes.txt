to report/analyse:

Significance of the YearMonth Column
Temporal Data: This column likely represents the month and year of an event (e.g., phone launch, churn, claims data, or subscriptions).
Understanding the time period is critical for analyzing:
Trends over time (e.g., increase or decrease in claims, churn rate).
Seasonality (e.g., more claims in specific months).
Time-based comparisons (e.g., Year-over-Year or Month-over-Month analysis).
